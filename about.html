      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Khianix Barbershop started as a small local shop with one chair and a dream. Over the years, with dedication and the support of loyal clients, 
        it has grown into a trusted destination for grooming. What began as a passion for clean fades and sharp cuts 
        has become a full-service barbershop rooted in tradition, style, and professionalism.
